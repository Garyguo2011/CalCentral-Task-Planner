In order to show a more accurate busy score (i.e. the score represents their workload)
I want to design an estimate algorithm to calculate busy score

scenario: show workload estimate 
Given I am in the home page 
Then I should see the “Busy score” 
When I go to HW1 page  
Then I should see “Time Spend” 

Then I select 2 hours 
Then I should see the “Busy score” increase 

When I delete HW1 task 
Then I should see the “Busy score” decrease
