  And I am on the sign-in page
  Given I sign in "xinran@gmail.com" with "111111111"
  Then I should be on the homepage
  
Scenario: Should receive email that show task due this week
  Given it is currently Apr,5 2015
  Then I should see "Email Notification have been sent!" in "Notificaiton Status"
  Then I should receive email contains "Typo-blog", "Homework6", "Proj3"

Scenario: [TO BE CONTINUE] we need to check more testing document for test emails.
